# Customer prediction model 
This is a project I did for a class. I used an open-source database showing customer data, and the goal is to predict whether the consumer will switch to a diffrerent provider. I am building GridSearchCV with Linear Reression and SVC while using two scoring methods, accuracy and roc_auc. 


**Installation:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LouaiAlJabi/GridSearchCV_Prediction_Model.git
cd Bootstrap

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
